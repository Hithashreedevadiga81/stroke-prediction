# Stroke Prediction and Analysis Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the risk of stroke using various machine learning algorithms based on patient health and lifestyle data. It aims to assist in early detection and prevention by providing accurate, data-driven insights through an intuitive web-based interface.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Predicts stroke risk based on clinical and lifestyle inputs  
- Implements data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation  
- Built using Python with Streamlit for the web interface  
- Supports scalable and user-friendly deployment  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling and preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models   
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  

## 📁 Dataset  
- [stroke prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares data with normalization and feature selection  
2. **Model Training:** Trains multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
4. **Web App:** Users input data through Streamlit interface to get stroke risk predictions  


## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Integration with real-time health monitoring systems  
- Expanded feature set and model tuning  
- Deployment on cloud platforms
